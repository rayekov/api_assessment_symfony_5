## assessment on creating an api that fetch data from a mysql database with filters 
### Technologies

* Symfony v5.3
* Doctrine v2.9.3
* Varnish v4
* NodeJS v10
* MySQL v5.7x


What i did so far :

[x] Modeled the database in Doctrine, using the existing foreign key references to define relationships between tables.

[x] Created a REST API in Symfony using Doctrine that presents an endpoint for loading data from the sample database serialised using JSON.

[x] Allowed support for ‘date range’ and ‘company’ parameters, where multiple companies can be selected.

[x] Extended the MySQL schema to include tables for saving all user settings, including API parameters, client-side filters, sorting and paging settings.
